Personal Website

This website consists of my personal information, Technical skills that I have, Interested Fields, Courses and their certifications, Project experiences and some extracurricular activities that I have done during past years.

Initially this web site template is a free template that I have found from internet. As I was a beginner for HTML I had to find an attractive template.  But I have changed all the template according to my needs after getting some knowledge oh HTML by self studying the template.
